I made this example of a form registration Web Application using CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete), which are basic functions of databases or the persistence layer of all software, implementing the Java Servlest that are modules written in Java that are used on a server, which may or may not be a web server, to extend its response capabilities to clients by using the capabilities of Java, which have access to the entire family of Java APIs, including the JDBC API for accessing business databases.
